        about: "Aquarius is the 11th sign of the zodiac, belonging to the air element, making them objective, erudite, and analytical. They are confident, self-assured, determined, and fascinated by new things, making them inventors and discoverers. Aquarians value freedom, independence, and are a bit rebellious. They are sociable, charming, and humanitarian, but find it difficult to maintain deep relationships due to their volatility and emotional aloofness. They are progressive, original, and philanthropic, fighting for various causes.",

        career: "Aquarius-born people have a unique talent for analytical thinking and can excel in science, medicine, and the arts. They can also do well in the field of law and are generally not worried about financial matters. However, their tendency to indulge in charity can sometimes lead to financial losses. A personalized Natal Chart based Finance Report can help plan finances wisely.",

        health: "Aquarius-born people have a weak bone structure and can suffer from fractures due to even minor accidents. They may also experience health problems related to their nervous system, heart, backbone, throat, and bladder. Their digestive system, however, can adapt to various cuisines easily. Overthinking can cause brain disorders, which can lead to brain tumor or epilepsy in the long run. Despite these health concerns, they usually live to a ripe old age in good health. Anatomically, Aquarius corresponds to the coccyx, calves, ankles, cones and rods in the eyes, lower leg bones, muscles in the calves, ankles and shins, and arteries and veins in the lower leg.",

        love: "Aquarians value their personal freedom and do not like anyone who interferes with it. They are charming people and those who enter their personal space will find them interesting. Aquarians in love tend to share intellectual and artistic interests with their partners, and prefer to approach love and marriage in a logical and intellectual way. They are accommodating, will compromise, and adapt to their partner's nature. Aquarius-Aquarius, Aquarius-Gemini, and Aquarius-Libra are considered good matches for Aquarians.",

        nature: "Aquarius are generous and compassionate, but different from other kind signs such as Pisces or Cancer. They are practical and have a keen eye for deception. They are supportive and encouraging as parents, spouses, or friends and are always ready to help with genuine and unbiased advice. However, their unpredictable behavior due to their unconventional mindset and rebellious nature sometimes makes them difficult to understand. They are friendly people but not known to change their minds or opinions easily.",

        relationships: "Aquarius-born individuals are compassionate, sensitive, intelligent, and affectionate but also aloof and very intuitive. They value personal space so much that it can lead to loneliness. They appreciate beauty and are gentle, but their unconventional thinking and creativity can result in unpredictable behavior. They have a desire to expand their knowledge, and their analytical minds lead them towards science and invention. They are patient and persevering but not easily agitated, and they are not quick to change their opinions.",

Ruled by Neptune, they are detached, spiritual, and focused on inner journeys for peace and harmony. Pisces tend to avoid conflicts and take roundabouts to navigate through life.",

        career: "Pisces are often drawn to spiritual and occult matters, and are highly creative and emotional. They can excel in performing arts or the medical field, as well as physics. Their independent streak and dislike of routine can sometimes cause distractions, but they are highly compassionate and charitable. They are also not inclined to chase after owed money, expecting it to be returned voluntarily.",

Anatomically, Pisces corresponds to feet, toes, lymphatic system, duodenum, cecum, bones, muscles, arteries and veins in the extremities.",

        love: "The Pisces are gentle, humble and emotional souls who are exceedingly romantic and creative. They seek fairy tale endings and are more in love with the idea of love than being in love itself. They are attracted to good looks but also need intelligence in a partner. Scorpio and Cancer natives are considered to be good companions for the Pisces.",

        nature: "Pisces are modest, calm, and enjoy a cozy environment. They are loving, caring, and loyal, making them great parents and partners. However, if they are jilted in love or display negative traits, they can become subject to ill-treatment, betrayal, and laziness. Their love is more about giving than receiving, and they are often too timid in their ways, leading to being taken for granted. In their extreme negative behavior, Pisces may exhibit complete inaction, hedonism, vindictiveness, or multiple relationships.",

        relationships: "The Pisces are known for their generous and compassionate nature, but they have a carefree approach to life, struggle with discipline, and can become overwhelmed easily. They may turn to alcohol or drugs to escape and may have trouble opening up on a personal level. They can be impractical and uncomfortable in dealing with the real world, but are independent and brave. They may also become confused and have difficulty completing tasks.",
